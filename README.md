### Step by step of how to create a branch
Each time you do any piece of code for this project, we don't want to do it in the master project. We want the master project to **Always** be a working application. So we will be creating branches of our code each time we want to make a change to anything in the application.

* Open your GitKraken
* At the top you will see branch, click it
* You will see that it will take you to the tree and ask you to input the name of your new branch
* You will then add in a name, for example if we are making a feature for the login you will put feature/login.
* Enter the name of the branch and press enter.
* This creates a new branch for you to be working on in your code.
* Open up visual studio to use your branch and start coding.
* Once you have finished your code, go back to GitKraken
* You will see on the right hand side that it will have one or more "Modified" files, under "Unstaged Files"
* This is the work you have just done
* You want to then click on these changes you have made that you would like to upload and then  click stage file
* It will then move to "Staged Files"
* From there you cannot commit any files unless it has a Summary
* You want to enter a brief description of what you have just done, for example: Change title to say "Hello" 
* Once you have an appropriate Summary you can then commit the file with the button at the bottom that says "Stage files/changes to commit"
* Once you have commit the file/files you then need to click the "Push" button at the top to commit it to your local repo
* You will see that it has saved the changes to your local application
* To then save it to the remote repo you will then double click on your branch name under you local application on the left hand side and click push
* It will then prompt you at the top of what you would like it call it
* Leave that as what it is, you should never have to change it
* Then click submit at the top next to your origin and branch name (without changing it)
* If you then go to GitHub.com in your browser you will see under branches that your one has now been added
* You then click on "New pull request" next to your branch name
* You can then leave a comment saying "I have done this and this etc" and click "Create pull request"
* You will then see that it needs 2 approvals before it can be submitted to the master fully
* Everyone will be notified and 2 people can check it and then as long as it is all a-ok the submit can be published to the master
